## rake Task Management Tool

[rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) is ruby's make.
In takelage it is used as a command wrapper.
While the 
[takelage cli](https://github.com/geospin-takelage/takelage-cli) 
`tau` handles global not project specific tasks
like “log in to the development environment”
or “download updates of bit components”
`rake` handles project specific tasks like
“test the build” or “tag the image”.
