## bit Components Sharing Tool

[bit](https://docs.bit.dev/) is an 
[open-source](https://github.com/teambit/bit)
cli tool for collaborating on isolated components 
across projects and repositories.

bit is a 
[git](https://git-scm.com) extension.
bit is not meant to replace git.
You may think of bit as a git powered clipboard manager
with versioning and central storage.
For open source projects you may use 
[bit.dev](https://bit.dev)
as your central bit storage.
For software testing or private use you may use a 
[bitboard server](https://github.com/geospin-takelage/takelage-bit)
created with this project.

Both bit and git are in their core free and open source tools.
Around these tools both free and non-free infrastructure has emerged.
git sparked projects like 
[GitHub](https://github.com) and 
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) while bit has been
developed by Cocycles, the company behind 
[bit.dev](https://bit.dev).

bit.dev's intended audience is the javascript community and
they also host the best resources for bit: 
the [bit docs](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/faq).

The takelage devops workflow uses the open source parts of bit.
The bit part of takelage is targeting devops engineers.
It enables them to share parts of their git repositories.
And they may inject private data into open source projects.
